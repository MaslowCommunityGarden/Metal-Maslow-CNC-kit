# Metal Maslow CNC kit

Original Maslow + Metal Sled, Cbeam Z axis,  Arduino enclosure &amp; more.
Our complete kit takes off where the orginal left off with many upgraded features and quicker assembly times. 
As the above photo shows the main benefit of our kit is is comes with a premade sled, z axis and linkage kit which only takes about 15 minutes to put together vs the original kit. 
Other benefits include:
1. Upgraded circuit board with 3 heat sinks and relay control box to turn the router on and off
2. Longer nickle plated chain that supports 12' motor spaceing for more accurate bottom corner cuts
3. Makita RT0701C router with 1 year warranty. ( will also sell without router)
4. C-Beam Axis with faster Z axis motor mount and clamp for above router. Ridgid or any 3.5" diameter router, & Dewalt 611 can also be supported if a different clamp is used.  Both of these routers are widely available in Europe and other countries in 220v.
5. Laser Cut Steel Base plate so ring, router, z axis etc. lines up exactly. 
6. TLE5206 Power Control Board with AUX pins and fan cooled aluminum enclosure. PREPROGRAMMED & TESTED WTIH GROUND CONTROL 1.26
7. Pulleys for counter weighting the slack chain side instead of elastic cord.
8. AUX cable and metal plate for Zeroing the z axis
