Assembly instructions for the metal maslow cnc machine can be found here:
https://www.metalmaslow.com/assembly-instructions
The main differences between our assembly & the original maslow are as follows:
1. The metal laser cut sled is included in our kit and takes about 15 minutes to assemble.
Therefore there is no need to spend hours making a temporary sled and then a final sled.
2. We recommend a larger motor spacing of 12' and motor beam height of 30" vs 10' and
18" for the original kit. These larger dimensions give better corner to corner cut 
performance.  10 degree tilt vs 15 degrees is also recommended.


We will also be selling a metal top cross beam that is laser cut. 
By including this part, all machines we sell will be mechanically identical.
Since the machines are all the same troubleshooting any issues should be much simpler.
While one can save about $20 and spend an hour calibrating their own unique 2x4" wooden 
cross beam this method lacks consistency and it is harder to figgure out any issues since
everyone's machine is slightly different.
